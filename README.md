# palo_alto_python

Working to build a script/app that takes all of the operational proceedures one would have to perform during the upgrade process and do them automatically.

This works on either a clustered pair or stand alone device.

Only tested on version 8.0.0 and above.

```
git clone https://github.com/jcoeder/palo-alto-python.git
cd palo-alto-python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
