# palo_alto_python

Working to build a script/app that takes all of the operational proceedures one would have to perform during the upgrade process and do them automatically.

This works on either a clustered pair or stand alone device.

Only tested on version 8.0.0 and above.

git clone

cd palo-alto-python
